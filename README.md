Notes.
this is the setup I am going for. do know all the panels will be on at once and stacked onto each other.
we are going to use the actions, and listener, to turn panels on and off.


--Frame 
  --main menu Panel
    --Create Character Button (JButton)
    --Import Character Button(JButton)
    --Exit(JButton)
  --select Gender panel
  --Character Creator panel
    --stats sub-panel
    --Character Portraits subpanel
      --Character Portraits label
    --feet's subpanel
  --import Character panel
